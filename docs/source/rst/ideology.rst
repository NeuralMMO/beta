|icon| Abstract
###############

Progress in multiagent intelligence research is fundamentally limited by the complexity of environments available for study. Neural MMO is a massively multiagent AI research platform inspired by Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) role playing games -- self-contained worlds featuring thousands of agents per persistent macrocosm, diverse skilling systems, local and global economies, complex emergent social structures, and ad-hoc high-stakes single and team based conflict.  Our goal is not to simulate the near-infinite physical processes of life on Earth but instead to construct an efficient facsimile that incentivizes the emergence of high-level social and general artificial intelligence. To this end, we consider MMOs the best proxy for the real world among human games.

The long-term goal of Neural MMO is **agents that scale to the complexity of the real world**. The project is divided into research and engineering modules that cleanly segment this objective into concrete and approachable research and engineering tasks: *agents that scale to the complexity of their environment* and *environments that scale to the complexity of the real world*.

This dual problem formulation is core to the guiding ideology of the project. Depending on your own personal conception of where the field is as the moment, this may seem like a practical philosophy, AGI cultism, or anything in between. Regardless, see this `[Two Pager] <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_76rYTPtPysSh2_cFFz3Mfso-9VL3_tF5ziaIZ8qmS8/edit?usp=sharing>`_ for a more thorough overview of the project approach and objective.

The discussion of failure modes below is mostly intended to dissuade skepticism, which thus far I've found correlates perfectly with lack of familiarity with MMOs. If you are very familiar with MMOs + current AI research and are still skeptical, please contact me on the Discord -- I'd love to hear your views.

####################

We are currently aware of three failure cases for the project:
  * Computational infeasibility
  * "Agents that scale to their environment" is too hard
  * "Environments that scale to the real world" is too hard

The first failure case is a serious risk, but is shared among all areas of the field. This project is not uniquely compute intensive -- in fact, it is one of few environments where it is straightforward to train reasonable policies on a commodity desktop. If scale is the main issue here, it is likely shared among most if not all other approaches.

The second problem is probably more familiar to researchers as exploration. Given a cold start, how can agents bootstrap both to better policies and to better exploration strategies? This is a hard problem, but it is unlikely to kill the project:
  * RL has proven tremendously effective at solving hard exploration tasks in recent years
  * `Curriculum based approaches <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14876>`_ enable learning even when it is not feasible to specify a reasonable reward signal
  * The environment of this project is designed collaboratively to assist agents early on in learning, rather than adversarially as a hard benchmark

The third problem probably appears most likely to many researchers, but least likely to anyone who has spent a significant amount of time in an MMO. Here is a map of the NYC subway:

Actually, it's a quest map of Runescape, a particular MMO that our environment is loosely based upon. Each quest is a puzzle in itself, takes anywhere from several minutes to several hours to complete, is part of an interconnected web of prerequisites of other quests, and provides different incentives for completion ranging from equipment to unlockable content to experience in a tightly connected set of skills:

The most complex class of games considered to date is MOBAs (Massive Online Battle Arenas, e.g. Dota, Quake CTF), which are round based, take on order of an hour, and are mechanically intensive. Achieving 99 in all skills and acquiring the best gear in Runescape takes, at minimum, several thousand hours. In a tournament setting where attacking other players is allowed everywhere, moment-to-moment gameplay is less important than balancing the risks and rewards of any potential strategy--especially in the presence of hundreds of other players attempting to do the same. There is almost certainly still a complexity gap from MMOs to the real world, but we believe it is much smaller than that in environments currently available.

While our environment is nowhere near the level of complexity of a real MMO yet, it does contain key properties of persistence, population scale, and open-endedness. As agents begin to reach the ceiling of the current environment, we plan on continuing development to raise the ceiling.
