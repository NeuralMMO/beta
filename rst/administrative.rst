I, `[Joseph Suarez] <https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsuarez/>`_, am the primary author of Neural MMO. I plan to continue development for at least the duration of my EECS PhD at MIT or until someone convinces me that there is a better way to solve AGI.

Some assets previously used in this project belong to `Jagex <https://www.jagex.com/en-GB/>`_, the creators of Runescape, such as
